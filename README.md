Password Generator
  This is a Python script that generates secure random passwords for use on websites and other online services. The script allows the user to specify the length of the   password and includes only characters that are allowed by the website being used.

Getting Started
  Prerequisites
  Python 3.x installed on your system.
Installing
  Download the password_generator.py file to your computer.
  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
  Run the script by typing python password_generator.py and pressing enter.
Usage
  When you run the script, you will be prompted to choose an option:

Enter 1 to generate a new password.
Enter 2 to exit the script.
If you choose option 1, you will be prompted to enter the desired length of your password (between 6 and 20 characters). The script will then generate a random password using only characters that are allowed by the website being used. You will be shown the password and prompted to confirm it. If you confirm the password, the script will exit. If you do not confirm the password, the script will generate a new one.

If you choose option 2, the script will exit.

Security
  This script uses the random module to generate secure random passwords. The list of characters used by the script is limited to only those characters that are    allowed by the website being used, which reduces the risk of generating a password that contains disallowed characters. The script prompts the user to confirm their password to prevent typos.
